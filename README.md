# JWTAuth_for_FinanceManager - Learning JWT Authentication

This repository hosts Finance Manager, a simple web application developed as a learning project to implement JWT (JSON Web Token) Authentication. This project serves as a foundation for understanding security and authentication concepts and will eventually lead to a larger-scale financial management application hosted in a separate repository.

Features
* JWT Authentication:
     Secure user login and API access with stateless authentication.
* Spring Security Integration:
     Protect endpoints and manage user sessions securely.
* Data Persistence:
    Store and manage user and financial data in a relational database using JPA.

Learning Objectives:

Understand and implement JWT Authentication using Spring Security.
Explore Spring Boot to build secure RESTful APIs.
Practice Spring Data JPA for database interactions.
Learn best practices for securing endpoints and managing user sessions.

How Each Technology is Used

*Spring Security:
  Manages user registration and login.
  Secures API endpoints by validating JWT tokens passed in the Authorization header.

*JWT:
  Encodes user authentication data in a token for stateless session management.
  Provides a scalable and secure method for authenticating RESTful APIs.

*Spring Data JPA and Hibernate:
  Maps Java objects to database tables.
  Manages user and financial data through repositories.


*Tech Stack*

*Backend
*Spring Boot:
  Rapid application development with minimal configuration.
  Provides a robust framework for REST API development.

*Spring Security:
  Handles user authentication and authorization.
  Secures endpoints with JWT-based token validation.

*JWT (JSON Web Tokens):
  Stateless mechanism for authenticating API requests.
  Tokens are generated upon login and validated for secured requests.

*Spring Data JPA:
  Simplifies database access with ORM (Object Relational Mapping).
  Handles CRUD operations for financial records and user data.

*Hibernate:
  JPA implementation for seamless database interaction.
  Database

*SQL Database (MySQL/PostgreSQL):
  Stores user credentials, JWT tokens, and financial data.

*Tools and Utilities
  Maven: For project build and dependency management.

Future Plans

Expand this project into a comprehensive financial management application.
Features planned for the larger-scale application:
Detailed expense categorization.
Graphical reports and data visualization.
Multi-user support and role-based access.
Secure file upload/download for financial documents.
